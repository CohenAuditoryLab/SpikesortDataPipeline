# TDTtoKiloSort

Run pipelineRunner.bat to sort raw TDT data in both KiloSort and WaveClus, then run metric analysis.

Update these variables in setPaths.bat as needed:
- origin: the full file path to the folder of raw TDT files to be sorted
- dest: the full file path to the folder to store the sorting data, including the raw files from origin
